# inter-city_travel_network
This repository contains the data and analytics codes for the research paper titled "Evolution of inter-city travel network: a weighted network analysis of highway and railway travel". In this study, long-term evolution patterns of inter-city travel networks were evaluated using 40 years of railway and highway travel data. 

There are two types of data. The first type is the raw data that contains origin-destination traffic flow between the tollgates of highways and railway stations. The second type is city-level aggregated travel data of which the spatial unit of origin and destination nodes are cities in South Korea. 

Along with the accessed data and codes, we constructed a visualization dashboard to observe the changes in the network characteristics for the entire period of the time.
